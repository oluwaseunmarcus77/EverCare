      <p>
        EverCare Home Health offers a full range of in-home care services to seniors and adults with disabilities in the Chicagoland area.
        Our highly trained homemakers understand that you need quality care for your loved ones, so we work with you and your loved one to create a care plan based on their specific needs and assign a homemaker to fulfill that plan.
        
        We are structured to provide specific levels of senior home care services for your loved one.
        Our elderly in-home care assistance is an alternative to an assisted living facility or nursing home.
        This allows your loved one to enjoy independence and the comfort of home.
